Understanding weather patterns and trends is essential for various applications such as agriculture, disaster management, and climate research. This project involves analyzing and visualizing weather data to uncover insights and trends. By leveraging MATLAB’s powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities, we developed a comprehensive understanding of how to handle real-world data.
Objective:
● Applied MATLAB fundamentals learned in previous assignments to a real-world data analysis project.
● Imported, processed, analyzed, and visualized weather data using MATLAB.
● Developed a comprehensive report summarizing the findings.

Tasks Performed:

Data Acquisition and Preparation:
● Task 1.1: Imported weather data from a CSV file containing historical weather records (e.g., temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed).
○ Used the readmatrix function to import data.
○ Inspected the data and handled any missing values or anomalies.
Task 1.2: Organized the data into appropriate MATLAB data structures.
○ Used tables or matrices to store and manipulate the data.
○ Extracted relevant columns for analysis.

Basic Data Analysis:
● Task 2.1: Calculated basic statistical measures for each weather parameter (mean, median, standard deviation).
○ Used built-in MATLAB functions for statistical analysis.
Task 2.2: Identified trends and patterns in the data.
○ Plotted time series graphs for temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
○ Used moving averages to smooth the data and highlight trends.

Advanced Data Analysis:
● Task 3.1: Performed correlation analysis between different weather parameters.
○ Calculated correlation coefficients and create scatter plots to visualize relationships.
● Task 3.2: Implemented linear regression to model the relationship between temperature and other weather parameters.
○ Used the polyfit and polyval functions to fit and evaluate the regression model.
○ Plotted the regression line and analyze the results.

Data Visualization:
● Task 4.1: Created comprehensive visualizations to present the analysis.
○ Used subplot to create multiple plots in a single figure.
○ Customized plots with titles, labels, legends, and annotations.
● Task 4.2: Developed 3D surface plots to visualize temperature variation over time and space.
○ Used the surf and mesh functions to create 3D plots.

Report Generation:
● Task 5.1: Compiled the analysis and visualizations into a well-organized report.
○ Used MATLAB’s publish feature to generate a report in PDF or HTML format.
○ Included descriptive text, code snippets, and visualizations.
● Task 5.2: Summarized the key findings and insights from the data analysis.
○ Discussed any notable trends, correlations, and anomalies.
○ Provided recommendations or potential applications of the findings.

Project Presentation:
● Task 6.1: Prepared a presentation summarizing the project.
○ Created slides highlighting the problem statement, objectives, methodology, and key findings.
○ Included visualizations and key insights in the presentation.
